Hi Thorsten and Mark,

This is an update on my progress so far.

I'm trying out writing this as literate Agda to make it easier to write the definitions, but let me know if you have any issues reading this.

So I've proven as far as Lemma 1.3 using the Agda standard library.
I've been porting it over to 1Lab, it seems that it would be a similar amount of work to port it to the Agda cubical library. The main sticking point is working with `Fin` is much harder in 1Lab because of the way that Fin is defined. There's the following definitions of Fin:

```agda
-- Indexed inductive type
-- From agda-stdlib
data Fin : ℕ → Set where
  zero : Fin (suc n)
  suc  : (i : Fin n) → Fin (suc n)

-- Bounded naturals (with irrelevant proof)
-- From 1lab
record Fin (n : ℕ) : Type where
  constructor fin
  field
    i       : ℕ
    ⦃ bounded ⦄ : Irr (i < n)

-- Agda Cubical main definition
Fin n = Σ[ k ∈ ℕ ] k < n

-- Alternative definition in Agda Cubical
Fin zero = ⊥
Fin (suc n) = ⊤ ⊎ (Fin n)

-- Agda Cubical main except that <ᵗ is defined by computing the trichotomy of two integers, and is either ⊤ or ⊥, making it propositional.
Fin n = Σ[ k ∈ ℕ ] k <ᵗ n
```
