Hi Thorsten,

I don't exactly know what the issue was with the standard inductive
definition `Fin₁`. As I mentioned in my last email, someone left this
comment in the Agda cubical library.

```agda
-- Currently it is most convenient to define these as a subtype of the
-- natural numbers, because indexed inductive definitions don't behave
-- well with cubical Agda. This definition also has some more general
-- attractive properties, of course, such as easy conversion back to
-- ℕ.
```

The proof can be done using `apd` and `transport`, I'm pretty
sure. Running up against the limits of my current understanding. I
spent most of today reading the HoTT book to get myself up to
speed. The definitions are subtly different between the book, and the
two cubical libraries (1Lab and Agda Cubical). Nothing insummountable,
just need to spend more time immersed in it.

The specific lemma I encountered it was,

```agda
fshift≡+ꟳ : ∀ (x y : Nat) (a : Fin y) → fshift≡+ᵀ x y a
fshift≡+ꟳ x y a =
  fshift x a
    ≡⟨ refl ⟩
  fin (lower (fshift x a)) ⦃ Fin.bounded (fshift x a) ⦄
    ≡⟨ ap (λ ○ → fin ○ ⦃ {!!} ⦄) eq ⟩
  fin (x +ℕ lower a) ⦃ {!!} ⦄
    ≡⟨ refl ⟩
  fin (x +ℕ lower a) ⦃ bounded ⦄ ∎
  where
    bounded : Irr (x +ℕ lower a < x +ℕ y)
    bounded = +-preserves-<l (lower a) y x <$> Fin.bounded a
    eq : lower (fshift x a) ≡ x +ℕ lower a
    eq = fshift≡+ x y a
```


I'm still in until July, and I'm free all day on Friday.

Kind regards,

Christina
